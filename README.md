Customer Intent Prediction and Classification
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict customer responses (e.g., "yes" or "no") for marketing calls in the European banking sector. We aim to improve the success rate of calls by leveraging call center data and other customer features. The solution is designed to enhance call targeting and optimize marketing campaigns for higher success outcomes.

We work on various machine learning tasks such as:

Customer Intention Prediction and Classification
Sentiment Classification
üîç Problem Statement
Our goal is to develop a robust machine learning system that:

Improves customer engagement by predicting the success of calls made for various products.
Offers interpretability for clients to make informed decisions.
Leverages demographic data and call interaction data for higher accuracy.
üß∞ Features
Phase 1: Demographic-Only Modeling
A baseline model using only demographic data to predict customer responses.

Phase 2: Full Dataset with Call Outcomes
Incorporating full call center data to enhance model performance and prediction accuracy.

Phase 3: Layered Modeling Approach
Using a multi-layered approach with Ridge Classifier to predict "yes" responses and refine predictions for better accuracy.

Unsupervised Learning with KMeans
Segmenting customers into distinct clusters to personalize outreach strategies based on their features.

üìà Results Phase 1: Demographic-Only Modeling Using PyCaret, the Ridge Classifier with GridSearch achieved 60% accuracy. Despite applying techniques like Optuna, SMOTE, and other resampling methods, no significant improvement was observed in this phase.

Phase 2: Full Dataset with Call Outcomes Integrating call center data significantly improved model performance. The Gradient Boosting Classifier, identified using Hyperopt, provided the best results.

Phase 3: Layered Approach The two-step Ridge Classifier approach led to a major improvement in accuracy. From 6,323 predicted "yes" responses, 2,003 actual positive responses were accurately predicted, achieving 32% precision, a sharp increase from the initial 7% baseline.

Clustering Insights KMeans clustering revealed three key customer segments:

Cluster 1: Younger, blue-collar, single, good balance, contacted twice.

Cluster 2: Middle-aged, married, service jobs, lowest balance, contacted twice.

Cluster 3: Older, retired, single, high balance, contacted three times.

These insights help improve targeting and decision-making for client campaigns.

ü§ñ Future Work Model Optimization: Further optimization using advanced techniques like XGBoost, LightGBM, or Neural Networks.

Real-time Predictions: Implementing real-time call prediction models for dynamic campaign adjustments.

Interpretability: Adding model explanation techniques like SHAP or LIME for better interpretability.

üìù Conclusion This project demonstrates the potential for machine learning systems to enhance customer outreach strategies, specifically in the context of the European banking market. By combining demographic data, call center data, and advanced modeling techniques, I developed a system capable of increasing the success rate of customer calls. This product is designed to evolve with our clients' needs, ensuring not only high performance but also interpretability for informed decision-making.

My goal is to continue refining this adaptive machine learning product, offering data-driven solutions to improve customer engagement and business outcomes
